# Meet App
## Objective
- To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.
## Use of Serverless Functions in Meet App:
- Using AWS allows me, as the developer, to focus on the code rather than the structure of the hosting enviroment as well as allowing a cloud-based API to answer any common questions that may occur.
